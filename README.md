*Step 1: Get Your Project Ready*

Make sure your project folder looks something like this 👇


portfolio-angularjs/
│
├── index.html
├── about.html
├── contact.html
├── projects.html
├── js/
│   └── app.js
├── css/
│   └── style.css
├── images/
│   └── profile.png
└── README.md


✅ Tip:
Open it in *VS Code* (or your editor).
Make sure the project is working locally by opening index.html in your browser (or using *Live Server*).

🧭 *Step 2: Initialize Git*

Open *Terminal* in your project folder (you can use VS Code terminal).
bash
git init


 🧱 *Step 3: Add Your Files*

Now, add all your project files to Git:

bash
git add .


✅ This adds everything (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) to the staging area.

💬 *Step 4: Commit Your Files*

Now make your first commit:

bash
git commit -m "Initial commit - Portfolio Website using AngularJS"


✅ This saves your current version to Git history.

 🌐 *Step 5: Create a New Repository on GitHub*

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click on *“New Repository”* (top-right + button).
3. Enter repository name — for example:

   
   portfolio-angularjs
   
4. Choose *Public*
5. Don’t add a README (you already have one locally).
6. Click *Create Repository* ✅

## 🔗 *Step 6: Connect Local Project to GitHub Repo*

After creating the repo, GitHub will show you a few commands.
Copy and paste these in your terminal (replace your username):

bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/portfolio-angularjs.git


Example:

bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johndoe/portfolio-angularjs.git


Then push your files to GitHub:

bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main


✅ Boom! 🎉 Your code is now on GitHub!

Go to your GitHub repo page — refresh it — you’ll see all your files uploaded.

## 🖥️ *Step 7: Add a README File (if not already)*

If you didn’t already have one, create it:

1. In your project folder, make a new file called README.md
2. Add this content (you can modify it):

markdown
# 🌐 My Portfolio Website (AngularJS)

A responsive portfolio website built using AngularJS to showcase my skills, projects, and contact information.

## 🚀 Features
- Single Page Application (SPA)
- Dynamic project listing
- Responsive design
- AngularJS routing and controllers

## 🛠️ Technologies
- AngularJS
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap

## ⚙️ Setup
1. Clone the repo:


git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)<your-username>/portfolio-angularjs.git


2. Open in VS Code
3. Right-click `index.html` → Open with Live Server


Then commit and push it:

bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Added README"
git push


---

## 🌍 *Step 8: Host the Website on GitHub Pages*

Now let’s make it *live online* 🔥

1. Go to your *GitHub repository* → Click *Settings* ⚙️
2. In the left sidebar, click *Pages*
3. Under *Source*, choose:

   
   Branch: main
   Folder: /(root)
   
4. Click *Save*

Wait a few seconds ⏳
GitHub will give you a *public link* like this:


https://<your-username>.github.io/portfolio-angularjs/


 🧠 *Optional — Make It a Bit Cooler*

Add a CNAME file if you have your own domain, or customize your README with:

* Screenshots of your website
* Badges (like build status, stars, etc.)
* A link to your LinkedIn or resume

Example snippet:

markdown
## 📸 Screenshots
![Home Page](screenshots/home.png)
![Projects](screenshots/projects.png)


💥 *Example Final Link Format*

🔗 *GitHub Repository:*
[https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-angularjs](https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio-angularjs)

🌐 *Live Demo (GitHub Pages):*
